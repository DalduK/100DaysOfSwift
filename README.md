## Overview

Welcome to the "100 Days of Swift" challenge, inspired by Paul Hudson's popular iOS development course! 
I've completed half of this challenge last year, without showing my progress. Now I will try to complete it and record any progress along the way.

## About the Challenge

The "100 Days of Swift" challenge is an initiative to encourage developers to commit to daily coding practice for 100 consecutive days. The challenge covers a wide range of Swift and iOS development topics, allowing participants to gradually build their skills and confidence.

## Rules

If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:

1. Every day you spend one hour reading or watching Swift tutorials, or writing Swift code.
2. Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!
I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn.
